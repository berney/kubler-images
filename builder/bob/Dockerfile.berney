# The syntax line needs to be the first line

# There's two very similar Dockerfiles:
#   - Dockerfile.builder - has /distfiles and /packages
#   - Dockerfile.berney - clean, no /distfiles, no /packages
#
# The difference is berney one will produce an image without `/distifiles/` nor `/packages/` directories,
# because it's `RUN` had `--mount` with `type=cache`.
# This is intended to be the final clean image.
#
# The builder one is built first, and the image will have `/distfiles/` and `/packages/`, because it doesn't have the mount cache.
# A container can be created from the builder iamge, and the `/packages/` binpkgs and `/distfiles/` copied out to the localhost.
# These binpkgs can then be re-used in future builds.
# Because the two Dockerfiles are near identifical, after building the builder one, the berney one will use the BuildKit cache from the builder.
#
# After extracting the binpkgs, future builds will use them, e.g. when building a newer release, any packages that are unchanged between releases won't need to be recompiled as the binary packages can be installed.
# Because stages are being used, these named contexts can be overriden to copy files in from outside of the local build context, e.g. from the GHA cache.
